  <h1>HOBBIES</h1>
  <p>As someone who changes hobbies every three to five business days, here are some of my favorite ways to kill time :D</p>
	<h2>DRAWING</h2>
	<p>Drawing is something I have always love to do ever since I was a kid. Some people suggest that I should pursue an art-related major, but I think I enjoy drawing more when I do it purely for entertainment</p>

	<h2>ORIGAMI</h2>
	<p>"Origami" refers to the art of folding paper, orginally from Japan. This is not something I am passionate about, so I only choose to make things that take less than 10 minutes to learn lol. Even  though I only do basics stuff, I find it very relaxing and therapeutic</p>

	<h2>PLAY-DOH</h2>
	<p>Somehow it takes me hours to make the most simple stuff. Though it is fun, I only touch it like one every six months :/</p>
